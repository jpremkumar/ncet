        <h2>What is Full Stack Development?</h2>
        <p>
          Full stack development is the process of designing, creating, testing,
          and deploying a complete web application from start to finish.
          It involves working with various technologies and tools, including front-end web development,
          back-end web development, and database development.
        </p>
        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a
          <!-- <a href="#" data-text=" That means that code is not pre-compiled but instead evaluated, compiled and executed at runtime (e.g. when the browser executes the script)." class="info-modal">dynamic, interpreted</a> -->
          <a href="#" data-text="That means that code is not pre-compiled but instead evaluated, compiled and executed at runtime (e.g. when the browser executes the script)." class="info-modal">dynamic, interpreted</a>
          and
          <a href="info/weakly-typed.html">weakly typed</a>
          programming language which was built with the purpose of running in
          host environments (e.g. inside of a webpage in the browser).
        </p>
        <p>
          It's part of pretty much any page you visit in the web as it's the
          only "thing" in web development that allows you (= the developer) to
          change something on the page at runtime. Basically everytime
          something opens, closes, moves or changes on a webpage, JavaScript
          will be involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          There also a lot of webpages which are almost entirely powered by
          JavaScript (i.e. where a lot of the rendering work happens in the
          browser) - those pages typically use frameworks like Angular, but
          that's a topic we'll cover later in the course. :-)
